## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
One of my favorite apps is Notion because it is so versatile in taking notes and creating calendars and to do lists. I would like to create an app that is a lifestyle planner app that implementss good studying and will help plan out the game. I have an dea to implement a pomodoro style timer that will make sure that the users are studying for a set amount of time and then taking a break for another set of time. I would also add a calendar and a system that will timeblock the users day. There would also be a journal feature where the user can talk about their day and how each task made them felt. Instead of a regular journal it would get set prompts to help the users mindset. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
There were no challenges in regards to building the app, there were some problems in showing video walkthrough which is why it had to be screenrecorded.
